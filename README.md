***Simple Vulkan renderer to learns the basics of the API.*** <br />
I followed the [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) and then added some features.

The tutorial goes through every basic Vulkan objects, their uses, how they work together to get a basic forward renderer.

Features that I implemented to confirm my understanding :
- Blinn Phong shading
- Shadow map + soft shadows
- Environment settings
- ImGui
